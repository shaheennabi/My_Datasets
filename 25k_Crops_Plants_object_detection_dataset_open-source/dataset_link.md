# Open-Source Crop/Plant Object Detection Dataset

## Introduction
I am excited to open-source this dataset to help developers, researchers, and machine learning enthusiasts build object detection models for agricultural applications. This dataset consists of annotated images of **100 different crops/plants**, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating object detection models.

## Dataset Details
The dataset is available on **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/devshaheen/100_crops_plants_object_detection_25k_image_dataset)** and contains three splits:
- **Train:** 17,553 images with corresponding labels
- **Validation:** 4,990 images with corresponding labels
- **Test:** 2,458 images with corresponding labels

Each split contains:
- Images
- Labels (in YOLOv5 format)
- A `data.yaml` file for configuration

## Annotation
The dataset has been annotated using **Roboflow**, ensuring high-quality bounding box annotations for each crop/plant category.

## Download Dataset
Clone this repository to access the dataset:
